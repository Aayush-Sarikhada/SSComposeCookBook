## Guideline
A Guideline is an invisible, positionable line that can be used to position and align views within a ConstraintLayout. Guidelines can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, and their position can be specified as a percentage of the parent layout's width or height, or as a fixed distance from the start, end, top, or bottom.

## Barrier
A Barrier is a dynamic line that automatically positions itself based on the size of one or more views. Unlike a Guideline, a Barrier's position can change based on the size and content of the views it references.
